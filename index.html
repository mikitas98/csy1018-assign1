    My name is Miguel Guerreiro and I am 18 years old.
    I have been a student for most of my life and by doing that, today I know that I want to be successful by doing what I enjoy to do.
    I am very committed, I am very organised, I am friendly and sociable, I am very ambitious, I am very cooperative but the most important characteristic about me that I am proud of is that I am a fighter, I fight for what I love to do and for any objective that I establish in my mind.
    So I am very proud of my personality and what I am today.

<h6>Hobbies and Interests:</h6>
<ul>
  I have two hobbies that I consider very important to my life they are football and gaming.
Football makes me release the stress, teaches me how to cooperate, shows me the importance of mutual respect, gives me confidence, teaches me to be objective, teaches me that if I really want to win or to be successful I have to fight for it, teaches me how to manage my time effectively and it is also a good way of making new friends.
Concluding, football makes me a better person, makes me happy, helps me to improve myself and helps me a lot in university, because by releasing the stress and the anxiety and other feelings it helps me to be successful and to stay healthy not only physically but also psychologically.
Gaming is another way of releasing stress, it is another way of doing friends from all over the world and it is also something that I enjoy a lot doing.
Gaming is good to me because it helps me strengthen my cognitive skills such as spatial navigation, reasoning, creativity, memory and perception.
In conclusion these two hobbies are essential to me and they can be beneficial when it comes to the course I am attending to.
